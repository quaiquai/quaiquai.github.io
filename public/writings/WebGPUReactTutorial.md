WebGPU is an emerging technology that allows for high-performance graphics rendering directly in the browser. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to implement WebGPU in a React application using a script that simulates photon mapping. We'll break down the code step by step, focusing on the key concepts and functions that make this possible.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before we dive into the code, ensure you have a React environment set up. You can use Create React App or any other boilerplate. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install better-react-mathjax framer-motion react-markdown react-syntax-highlighter
```

# Code Structure Overview

The script consists of several parts, including imports, shader code, the main React component, and functions to manage WebGPU setup and rendering. Let’s break it down.

# Imports and Component Setup

The script begins by importing essential libraries and hooks:

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState, useRef, useCallback } from "react";

import { useWebGPU } from "./useWebGPU"; // Custom hook for WebGPU setup
import useCanvasSize from "./useCanvasSize"; // Custom hook for responsive canvas
```

- React Hooks: We use hooks like useEffect, useState, useRef, and useCallback to manage component state side effects, and references.
- Custom Hooks: useWebGPU handles WebGPU initialization, while useCanvasSize manages the canvas's dimensions, ensuring it’s responsive.

## WebGPU Shader Code

Two essential shader programs are defined: a vertex shader (vertWGSL) and a fragment shader (fragWGSL). These shaders are written in WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language) and perform the heavy lifting for rendering.
Vertex Shader

The vertex shader defines the position and UV coordinates for each vertex:

```wgsl
struct VSOut {
    @builtin(position) Position: vec4<f32>,
    @location(0)       uvs     : vec2<f32>
}; -->

<!-- @vertex
fn main(@builtin(vertex_index) VertexIndex : u32) -> VSOut {
    ...
}
```

Purpose: This shader computes the positions of a square and maps UV coordinates for texturing. The use of @builtin(position) ensures the shader outputs the correct vertex position.

Fragment Shader

The fragment shader contains the core logic for rendering the photon mapping effect. It calculates the intersection of rays with a sphere and generates light information:

```wgsl
@fragment
fn main(@location(0) coords: vec2<f32>) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
    ...
}
```

Purpose: This function computes the color output based on light interactions, generating realistic illumination based on photon mapping.

Setting Up the React Component

The main React component, Test, manages the WebGPU context and rendering loop:

```js
const Test = () => {
    const canvasRef = useRef(null);
    const canvasSize = useCanvasSize();
    const { adapter, device, canvas, context, format } = useWebGPU(canvasRef.current);
    
    const [isInitialized, setIsInitialized] = useState(false);
    ...
};
```

useRef: This hook is used to hold a reference to the canvas DOM element. This allows direct manipulation of the canvas without causing unnecessary re-renders.
useState: This hook tracks whether WebGPU has been initialized. This boolean is essential for managing the rendering flow.

WebGPU Initialization

The initializeWebGPU function sets up the necessary WebGPU components:

```js
const initializeWebGPU = useCallback(() => {
    if (!canvas || !context || !adapter || !device) return;

    const uniformBuffer = device.createBuffer({
        size: 4 * 3, // For uniform data
        usage: GPUBufferUsage.UNIFORM | GPUBufferUsage.COPY_DST
    });
    ...
}, [canvas, context, adapter, device, format]);

```

useCallback: This hook memoizes the initializeWebGPU function, ensuring it doesn’t get recreated on every render. This is particularly useful when passing the function as a dependency to other hooks.
Buffer Creation: The uniform buffer is essential for passing data (like camera angles) to shaders. The usage property specifies that the buffer will be used for uniforms and can be copied to the GPU.

# Render Loop

The render function is responsible for drawing frames:

```js
const render = useCallback(() => {
    if (!isInitialized) return;
    
    const { pipeline, uniformBindGroup, renderPassDescriptor } = webGPUContextRef.current;
    
    updateUniformBuffer();
    
    renderPassDescriptor.colorAttachments[0].view = context.getCurrentTexture().createView();
    
    const commandEncoder = device.createCommandEncoder();
    const renderPass = commandEncoder.beginRenderPass(renderPassDescriptor);
    renderPass.setPipeline(pipeline);
    renderPass.setBindGroup(0, uniformBindGroup);
    renderPass.draw(4, 1, 0, 0);
    renderPass.end();
    device.queue.submit([commandEncoder.finish()]);
}, [context, device, isInitialized, updateUniformBuffer]);

```

Command Encoding: This method manages the rendering commands sent to the GPU. It begins a render pass, sets the pipeline and bind groups, and issues a draw call.
Dependencies: By including dependencies like context, device, and isInitialized, we ensure that the function re-runs whenever any of these values change, maintaining the latest references and state.

# Animation and Interaction

The component captures mouse movements to control camera angles:

```js
const handleMouseDown = useCallback((e) => {
    ...
}, []);

const handleMouseMove = useCallback((e) => {
    ...
}, []);

```

Mouse Interaction: These handlers adjust camera rotation based on mouse input, creating an interactive experience. By using useCallback, we ensure these functions maintain the same reference across renders unless their dependencies change.

# Displaying Content

Finally, the component renders the canvas and additional content:

```js
return (

    <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
        <canvas ref={canvasRef} width={800} height={450} tabIndex={0} />
    </div>
);

```

Canvas Element: The canvas is where the WebGPU renders the graphics. The tabIndex attribute makes it focusable, allowing for keyboard events.
